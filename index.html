        <h2>About Devils Lake</h2>

            <p>Devil's Lake State Park, in Baraboo, Wisconsin, is the state's most popular state park, drawing nearly 3
                million annual visitors. Encompassing over 10,000 acres, Devil's Lake is part of over 27,000 acres of
                public recreational land in Sauk County. The park, also known as “Tewakącąk” or Spirit Lake, is situated
                on ancestral Ho-Chunk land and contains ancient effigy mounds that are part of their cultural heritage.

            <h2>History Of Devils Lake</h2>
            <p>Devil's Lake has drawn travelers since the 1800s. In 1873, the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad
                constructed a line through the park, which still runs along the east side. Tourists flooded in.
                Seasonal residences previously lined the north and south coasts, including the Ringling brothers' winter
                headquarters a few miles north. The south coast had many resorts. Lake steamer cruises and sculling
                regattas were held in summer.
                Devil's Lake became Wisconsin's third state park in 1911.
                A Civilian Conservation Corps unit in the 1930s built the north shore Chateau and the quartzite stairs
                to the East Bluff.
