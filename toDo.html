            <p>Devil's Lake has over 29 miles of hiking trails for any skill level, including amazingly scenic sections
                of the National Ice Age Trail. The trails vary in condition and difficulty from easy to challenging and
                are not maintained in the winter months.
                Steep climbs or descents and stairways are common on Devils Lake's hiking trails. Use caution when on
                the steep bluffs or near cliffs. Stay well away from cliffs and watch small children closely.

                Devil's Lake State Park is home to about 38 species of mammals, 115 species of birds, and many species
                of amphibians and reptiles including timber rattlesnakes. Though you are not likely to see all of them,
                there are a variety of birds and mammals you may encounter while in the park. Some of these animals are
                easy to spot, such as white deer crossing county road DL or the Turkey Vultures that fill the sky all
                summer long! Other species take patience and a good eye to see.

            <p>
                Devil's Lake State Park has no flat, paved or “family friendly” bike trails. Bicycles are only allowed
                on the Uplands Loop Trail within the park. Bikes are not allowed on any other trails within the park.
                he Uplands Loop Trail provides about 4 total miles of “mountain bike” trail at Devil’s Lake State Park.
                For a short distance from the Steinke Basin parking lot in either direction, the trail offers some
                medium effort sections on occasionally mowed grass trails, but soon cyclists will find themselves
                climbing over 200 feet to ride the fairly challenging Uplands Trail. Dirt, mud, loose rock & gravel,
                ruts, embedded boulders and fallen trees can create potential hazards on sections of the trail.

                Devil's Lake has both warm and cold water fisheries. Each year the DNR stocks the lake with Brown trout.
                Browns are taken mainly on small minnows or spinners of the steeply dropping east and west shores. You
                will also find Walleyes which are stocked, and Northern Pikes. Easy access fishing is available along
                the south shore of the lake where it is possible to fish just off the sidewalk. Please not however that
                power boats are not allowed on Devil's Lake.

            <p>Devil's Lake State Park has one “Mutli-Use” loop trail which is often packed but not “tracked”. This is
                the Steinke Basin Loop. Parts of the Johnson Moraine Trail may be packed as well. Depending on
                conditions, skiers often like to explore the park's Uplands Trail as well. This trail is not maintained
                for skiing but can be fantastic in fresh show!ƒ
